# Console-Finance


## Description

Code for analyzing the financial records of a company.


## How to access the analysis:

Open the URL in Google Chrome browser, right-click with your mouse and select "Inspect" from the menu to acces "Developer Tools" and interact with the console.

## Detailed changes in the code
- To show the number of months taken in analysis, I used the array.length property of the finances array.
- For the Total Net amount over the entire period, I used a "for Loop" to make a sum of each element of the finances array.
- To find the average of changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period, I created two "for Loops": the first to calculate the difference between each elements of the array and the second one to have the sum of all those differences.
- To show the month with the biggest profit and the one with the biggest loss, I've created a for Loop with 2 conditions.
